# Deploy on Google Cloud Platform

To deploy Langinfra on Google Cloud Platform using Cloud Shell, use the below script.
The script will guide you through setting up a Debian-based VM with the Langinfra package, Nginx, and the necessary configurations to run the Langinfra dev environment in GCP.

## Prerequisites

* A GCP account with the necessary permissions to create resources
* A project on GCP where you want to deploy Langinfra

## Deploy Langinfra in GCP

1. Click below to launch Cloud Shell.

2. Click **Trust repo**. Some gcloud commands may not run in an ephemeral Cloud Shell environment.
3. Click **Start** and follow the tutorial to deploy Langinfra.

## Spot/Preemptible Instance

When running a [spot (preemptible) instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible), the code and VM will behave the same way as in a regular instance, executing the startup script to configure the environment, install necessary dependencies, and run the Langinfra application. However, **due to the nature of spot instances, the VM may be terminated at any time if Google Cloud needs to reclaim the resources**. This makes spot instances suitable for fault-tolerant, stateless, or interruptible workloads that can handle unexpected terminations and restarts.
