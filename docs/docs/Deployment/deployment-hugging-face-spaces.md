HuggingFace provides a great alternative for running Langinfra in their Spaces environment. This means you can run Langinfra in the cloud without any local installation required. Here's how you can get Langinfra up and running on HuggingFace Spaces:


1. **Access Langinfra Space**: Open a Chromium-based browser and navigate to the [Langinfra Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langinfra/Langinfra?duplicate=true). This link directs you to a pre-configured environment for Langinfra.


2. **Duplicate the Space**: You'll encounter an option to duplicate the Langinfra space. This step involves a few simple decisions:

	- **Naming Your Space**: Assign a unique name to your new Space.
	- **Visibility Settings**: Choose between Public or Private visibility for your Space.
	- After setting these parameters, click on **Duplicate Space** to initiate the setup.
